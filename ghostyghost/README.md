GHOSTY GHOST
============

Ghosty Ghost is a flappy bird like game for the Uzebox. Artwork and music are original. Due to the game's scrolling nature, it is of at least moderate complexity for programmers new to the system. The project goals are to create a polished game free of bugs, provide ample documentation so others can learn from it, and to be one of the first games to give players a reason to adopt the Uzenet hardware.
